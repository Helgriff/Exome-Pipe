# Exome-Pipe

Scripts to run an exome sequence analysis pipeline (FastUniq - BWA - Coverage - Sam/Bcftools - Annotation - Filtering)

The bash 'Launch', Fastuniq and BWA scripts are mofified from code written by Yaobo Xu.

The VCF filtering scripts are the next generation of 'in-house' scripts refered to in PF Chinnery Exome publications.
