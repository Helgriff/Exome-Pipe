# Exome-Pipe

Scripts to run an exome sequence analysis pipeline (FastUniq - BWA - Coverage - Sam/Bcftools - Annotation - Filtering)

The bash 'Launch', Fastuniq and BWA scripts are modified from code written by Yaobo Xu (formerly of Newcastle Univeristy, now based at The Sanger Institute, UK).

The VCF filtering scripts are the next generation of 'in-house' scripts referred to in Rita Horvath and PF Chinnery (Newcastle) Exome publications.
